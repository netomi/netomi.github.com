Orekit is a space dynamics library, providing low-level components for the development of flight dynamics applications. On top of that
it is the best designed library that I am aware of and contains beautiful code from which you can learn a lot.

I have provided some components to the library, mainly:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.orekit.org/site-orekit-development/apidocs/org/orekit/models/earth/GeoMagneticField.html">Geomagnetic field models based on WMM / IGRF</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.orekit.org/site-orekit-development/apidocs/org/orekit/files/sp3/SP3Parser.html">SP3 orbit file parser</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.orekit.org/site-orekit-development/apidocs/org/orekit/models/earth/troposphere/SaastamoinenModel.html">Saastamoinen Tropospheric delay model</a></li> 
</ul>

Additionally I have served on the PMC (project management committee) for a while.
