ProGuard is a bytecode optimizer / shrinker and obfuscator that is also part of the Android build tools to minimize
Android applications as much as possible.

I have been the product lead and lead developer of this project (and its commercial sibling <a href="https://www.guardsquare.com/en/products/dexguard">DexGuard</a>) for several years.

Some of the notable personal contributions to the project:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard/tree/master/core/src/proguard/backport">Support for backporting Java 8 language features and API calls</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard/blob/master/core/src/proguard/optimize/Optimizer.java">Parallelization of optimization step</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard/tree/master/gradle">Gradle plugin</a></li>
<li>Many bugfixes and small improvements</li>
</ul>

ProGuard is an amazing piece of software, difficult to master but once you get used to it, everything feels natural.
