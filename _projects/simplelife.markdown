Simple life is small simulator for Conway's Game of Life. It allows to graphically modify the initial configuration
and simulate evolutions of this configuration with varying speeds.

THe project was my first experience developing a JavaFX / OpenJFX application and get used to its MVC approach and
property binding capability.
