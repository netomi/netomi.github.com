For several years I have been a very active contributor to the Apache Commons project which develops
reusable Java components.

The components I have been mainly involved with are:

  * Math
  * Collections
  * Codec
  * Email
  * Logging

I have served also on the PMC (Project Management Committee) and was release manager for various releases, especially
releasing Apache Commons Collections 4.0 after the project has been dormant for various years.
