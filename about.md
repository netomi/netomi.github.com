This GitHub page showcases a few of the things I have been working on and contains a blog
about things I find interesting to share.

In the past I have been involved as

<ul>
<li>an active member of the Apache Software Foundation</li>
<li>product lead of ProGuard / DexGuard</li>
<li>software developer for air traffic management systems and simulators (Airtopsoft, Eurocontrol)</li>
</ul>

I consider myself an expert in the Java / Android ecosystem, ranging from low-level bytecode engineering to library and
UI development in swing / javafx / android. In the past I have also coded in c / c++ / python and lately started using
kotlin as well.

My focus the last years has been mainly on product management and making sure that customer needs are satisfied in a fast paced environment. 
The last couple of years I have been working fully remote and was managing a team of developers from a remote location.

I am open for remote contracting positions, feel free to contact me.
